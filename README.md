# HD44780 16x2  LCD Display. 

This is a 8Bit-Mode avr-gcc library for the HD44780 16x2 Character LCD display.
This library is tested on AVR 2560, Arduino Mega and on AVR 328P. 

Important Notes: (Please read before using this library)

1.This library was only developed to try the lcd display on my AVR Mega. Many things in this library could be optimised (in respect to memory requirement, timing and others) and could be written in much intelligent way.

2.Please change the library according to your requirements. If you want to use this library for testing please change the DDRC and PORTS I/O registers in beginning of header file statement(define statements).
